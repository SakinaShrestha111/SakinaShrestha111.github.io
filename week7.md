This week was all about getting ready with the slides for our midterm presentation following with our data cleaning. The midterm presentatin took place throughout the day at the social science building where, I, got to see so many fascinating projects that other students are working with. We also worked on our final paper and talked to Dr. Anita Pandey to hear some of her feedback. For our final project, our target was to find more than 1000 plus data and we found it and the collected data was then processed for further cleaning. Then, to improve our accuracy much better than our mideterm project, we tested more machine learning models to check the accuracy. This week, we also worked on prediciting the top 10 genes that causes the lung cancer using different feature selection methods.
