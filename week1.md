During the first week, I met with my faculty mentor, Professor Roshan Poudel, and we discussed about our project which was about detecting genetic biomarkers and early lung cancer from transcriptomic disease. He explained us what biomarkers are and what sources we will be using for this project. I met with my co-team members and we introduced ourselves. Besides that that, this whole week was bootcamp, so we did a lot of coding throughout the week. We learned about dictionaries, used files like CSV, JSON, we also learned about the machine learning, used Scikit-learn, panda, numpy, github and it was fascinating learning new things.
