For this week, it was pretty much the same thing we did on week 2. We did more literature review. Our mentor assigned each of us to read 10 articles and point out the research gap, hypothesis , result and methodologies. We did more machine learning and python coding. We started on collecting our data for our project. We used pandas for data cleaning where we used transpose function to change our column and rows. We merged our datas too since everyone in my team found there own data that we are going to be using for our project. This week we also went on the field trip where we went to the John Hopkins APL which was very interesting. We met some supervisors who introduced us with their respective fields that they were working.
