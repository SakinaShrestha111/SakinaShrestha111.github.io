## About My Mentor

My mentor, Professor Roshan Poudel, specializes in developing stochastic models of calcium and other ion channels in cardiac myocytes. His research is focused on understanding these complex biological processes. Additionally, he is involved in educational research aimed at increasing undergraduate retention in computer science. He integrates critical thinking, active learning, and project-based learning into introductory CS programming courses. His work not only advances scientific knowledge but also improves computer science education for students.
