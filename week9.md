This week, we dedicated our time to preparing for our final project. We focused on writing our final research papers, ensuring all our ideas were clearly presented. Dr. Anita Pandey was incredibly helpful, offering valuable feedback that improved our work. Her guidance was instrumental in refining our papers. In addition to writing, we worked on our presentation slides for next week's presentation. We made sure the slides were visually appealing and informative. We also started rehearsing our presentation speech to ensure we communicate effectively. Overall, it was a productive week as we geared up for our final presentations. We feel confident about our progress and are excited to showcase our hard work.
