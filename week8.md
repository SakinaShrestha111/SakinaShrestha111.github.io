This week we got done with our coding part by findinf out our accuracy of all our machine learning models and we predicted the top 10 genes that causes long cancer. Our datasets was more than 1200 and we had to clean the data that we collected. Using python we converted the probe ids to gene ids. Moreover, we used different machine learning models to train and test the models. We also used heat maps, pie chart, bar graphs to describe our datasets visually. This week, we also worked on overleaf. Our mentor assigned each and every one of us to work with specific parts where I had to work on the methodology part.  We also sent our final paper to Dr. Anita Pandey for her feedback and made sure we are on the right track.
