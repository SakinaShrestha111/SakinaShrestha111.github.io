This week, we did our final presentation, marking the end of a great learning experience. As a junior at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, where I’m studying Computer Science, this internship has been incredibly valuable. Throughout the internship, I worked extensively with Python, which helped me improve my programming skills. I tackled challenging problems and learned how to develop creative solutions. The internship also taught me the importance of teamwork and good communication. Overall, this experience has made me more confident and prepared for my future career. I’m looking forward to graduating in 2025 and continuing to grow in the tech industry.
