This week we were preparing slides for the presentation which is going to be held on July 3rd. Our mentor assigned us which part each one of us was working. We spend most of the time this week on data cleaning and literature review. We were cleaning our data most of the time. Our data was collectd from SHCB and GEO. We had different datasets from different sites and we realized that the data had different format, some had empty and duplicate values and the most important part was we converted all probe IDS to ESNG IDS ensuring accurate comparison and analysis. Also, at the end of the week, we had some high school students who visited us during our lab sessions and we prepared a small powerpoint slides to them explaining them about artificial intelligence and machine learning so that they can have a little understanding about our project.
