During week 2
I met with my graduate mentor on week 2, since he went on a vacation and came back on second week. We discussed on our project at the beginning of this week which included things like how are we gonna start our project step by step. We were told to watch a youtube video about machine learning which used pandas, numpy, scikit learn, linear regression, logistic regression, and to learn about data cleaning and its importance. We also did literature review and read many research paper. We were assigned to read 10 paper per person and be familiar with the methods they used and the result. All in all, we are still working on machine learning, getting familiar using it since this project is going to be about machine learning.
