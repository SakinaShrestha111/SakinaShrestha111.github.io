For this week, we did more data finding. We also cleaned the data which took a lot of time and we combined our data. Our mentor gave us an assignment to make a powerpoint where I had to present the methodology part. He wants us to be confident for the presentation which is going to be held on July 3rd. We practised more python coding and did literature review. We discussed more on our project and also for the presentation which is going to be on July 3rd by assigning specific parts to each team members.
