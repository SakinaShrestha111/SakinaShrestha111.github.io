## About My Project

During this project, I will assist a team in developing a machine learning model to detect genetic biomarkers and early prediction of lung cancer from Transcriptomic Data.
  - Obtain transcriptomic datasets from public repositories
  - Identity and select the relevant features that are significant in lung cancer development using different analysis. 
  - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithm.
