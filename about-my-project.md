## About My Project

During this project, I will assist a team in developing a machine learning model to detect genetic biomarkers and predict early lung cancer from transcriptomic data. We will start by obtaining transcriptomic datasets from public repositories. Next, we will identify and select relevant features significant in lung cancer development through various analyses. Then, we will choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for our model. Finally, we will train and test the model to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
