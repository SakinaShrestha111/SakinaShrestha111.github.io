For this week, we worked on our presentation slides and we practiced a lot during our research labs. Unfortunately, the presentation was cancelled due to technical problems. We also worked on writing drafts for our research paper. Our mentor assigned each and everyone of us with different parts for our final paper so we had to work on our respective parts. At the end of the week we had a discussion where everyone assembled and we talked about how the project has been going so far. We also started using overleaf for our paper. For our project, we are planning to clean more than 1000 datas so, we are still in the phase of cleaning the data since it takes a lot of time. I would say most of the time we are cleaning datasets.
